## Actionability snapshot

| Verdict | Candidates |
|:---|---:|
| GO (no high/unknown competition detected) | 2 |
| REVIEW (manual checks needed) | 7 |
| AVOID (high risk signals) | 0 |
| High/unknown competition flags | 6 |

GO is a screening result only; confirm the original issue, competition, eligibility, and payout terms before starting.

## How to interpret this report

- **Opportunity** is a ranking score, not a probability of success or payment.
- **GO** means no high/unknown competition flag was detected and the score/risk thresholds were met; it is not a guarantee that the bounty is valid or unpaid.
- **REVIEW** means manually inspect the original issue, open pull requests, comments, assignment status, eligibility, deadlines, and payout terms before starting.
- **HIGH competition** means linked open pull requests, solution/payout signals, or an assigned contributor were detected.
- **Risk** is a heuristic based on suspicious wording, weak payment claims, repository status/activity, and discussion signals; it cannot establish trustworthiness.
